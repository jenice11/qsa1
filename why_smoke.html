                        Smoking among youth and adolescents is an issue that affects countries worldwide. While the extent to which smoking is viewed as a negative health behavior may vary across different nations, it remains an issue regardless of how it is perceived by different societies. The United States has taken numerous measures, ranging from changes in national policy surrounding youth cigarette access to changes in media campaigns, in attempts to eliminate the use of tobacco products among teenagers. Approximately 90% of smokers begin smoking prior to the age of 18.[1] In efforts to reduce the total number of smokers and negative effects smoking has on society, it is necessary to reduce the number of youth and adolescents who begin smoking.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        Numerous health consequences for cigarette smoking have been thoroughly documented. The top negative health causes that have been causally linked to cigarette smoking include cancers of the upper digestive tract, lung cancer, and chronic diseases including diabetes, coronary heart diseases, pneumonia, and overall poorer immune function.

                        <h3>Demographic Factors</h3>
                        <p>
                        Research has shown that there are certain personal factors that are correlated with higher usage of cigarettes and other tobacco products. Age has been identified as a risk factor, such that older adolescents are more likely to have higher rates of regular cigarette and other tobacco product use than younger adolescents.In terms of gender, males smoke more cigarettes per day, use cigarettes with higher nicotine content, and inhale smoke more deeply. Males have also demonstrated increased satisfaction from their cigarette, as well as shorter latency between the time they wake up in the morning and when they have their first cigarette,which are signs of greater nicotine dependence. Females continue to experience environmental pressure to smoke.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Psychosocial Factors</h3>
                        <p>
                        Certain interpersonal social factors have been associated with cigarette smoking. Adolescents who are involved in antisocial behaviors, such as fighting, stealing, and using other drugs are more likely to smoke than those who do not engage in antisocial behaviors.Parents exert a highly robust effect on a childâ€™s smoking behavior. An examination of parental influences found that youth whose parents smoked cigarettes had a greater likelihood of smoking cigarettes, and this effect increased with the number of smoking parents in the home. The timespan in which a child is exposed to parental smoking has also been associated with increased risk of smoking.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Biological Factors</h3>
                        <p>
                        While many of these environmental risk factors may exert a strong effect, there are also a series of biological risk factors that may increase the likelihood of an adolescent becoming a cigarette smoker. An examination of adolescents ranging in age from 12 to 19 found that heritability estimates for initiation of smoking ranged from 36% to 56% across varying samples, with similar heritability estimates for regular smoking ranging from 27% to 52%.These genetic risk factors do not operate in isolation from environmental risk factors, rather they often function synergistically to influence smoking behavior. For example, school environment (i.e. school smoking norms, prevalence of student smoking, etc.) has been shown to moderate the genetic risk factor for smoking in adolescents.

                        <h3>How to Keep Kids from Smoking</h3>
                        <p>Keeping children and teenagers from starting smoking is critical and they need your help. Youth smoking can be prevented by the combined efforts of families, schools, communities and policymakers. For example:

                        <ul><li>Parents can set a positive example for their children by not smoking themselves, and keeping their homes smokefree.</li>
                        <li>Schools can provide tobacco prevention programs to educate students about the dangers of smoking and tobacco cessation programs to help young people who are already addicted quit smoking for good.</li>
                        <li>States can pass legislation to increase taxes on tobacco products, pass and implement comprehensive smokefree indoor air laws, and limit minors' access to tobacco products.</li></ul></p>
                                            </p>
                                            <blockquote>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S., causing over 438,000 deaths per year.</li>
                        <li>Secondhand smoke is a serious health hazard for people of all ages, causing more than 41,000 deaths each year.</li>
                        <li>Marijuana smoke contains many of the same toxins, irritants and carcinogens as tobacco smoke..</li>
                        <li>Electronic cigarettes are a new tobacco product, and the potential health consequences and safety of these products are unknown.</li>
                        <li>Smokeless Tobacco products are a known cause of cancer, and are not a safe alternative to cigarettes.</li>
                        <li>Cigars have many of the same health risks as cigarettes, including causing certain cancers.</li>
                    </ol>
